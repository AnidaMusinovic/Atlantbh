In "Folder.zip" you can find the automation of smoke test cases performed in Cypress.
There are two ways you can run the Cypress to automate the tests.
One way is to open folder in Visual Studio Code -> View -> Terminal and enter command "npx cypress run".
The other way is over Cypress dashboard where you upload folder and run tests.
